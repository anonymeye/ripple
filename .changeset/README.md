# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works
with multi-package repos, or single-package repos to help you version and publish your code. You can
find the full documentation for it [in our repository](https://github.com/changesets/changesets)

We have a quick list of common steps to get you started:

## Adding a changeset

To add a changeset, run the following command:

```bash
npx changeset
```

This will prompt you with a series of questions about your change. The changeset will be added to the `.changeset` directory.

## Releasing

When you're ready to release, run:

```bash
npm run version
```

This will:
1. Update package versions based on changesets
2. Generate CHANGELOG.md files
3. Remove used changesets

Then build and publish:

```bash
npm run release
```

This will:
1. Build all packages
2. Publish to npm
